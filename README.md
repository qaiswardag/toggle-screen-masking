# Toggle between vertical, horizontal, and square reading modes

## Description

This project is a simple interactive web demo that allows users to toggle between **vertical**, **horizontal**, and **square** reading modes using radio buttons. The reading area dynamically follows the user's mouse movement within the browser viewport:

- **Vertical Mode**: The reading window spans full width with a fixed height (200px), following the mouse vertically as you move up and down the page.
- **Horizontal Mode**: The reading window spans full height with a fixed width (200px), following the mouse horizontally as you move left and right.
- **Square Mode**: A 200px by 200px square reading area follows the cursor in both directions (x and y), creating a focused view area.
